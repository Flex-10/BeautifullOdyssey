# BeautifullOdyssey

## Project Overview

BeautifullOdyssey is a RimWorld mod that enhances the visual appeal of buildings from the Odyssey DLC by replacing negative beauty values with positive ones.

Why make this change? For example, the GravEngine—a large, blue, shining building—originally had a beauty value of -10. Personally, I would be impressed to have something like that in my house, so I changed its beauty value to +20.

## Features

This mod changes the beauty values for the following Odyssey DLC buildings:

| Building                    | Old Beauty | New Beauty |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **GravEngine**              | -10        | +20        |
| **GravshipShieldGenerator** | -10        | +10        |
| **GravFieldExtender**       | -10        | +10        |
| **SignalJammer**            | -10        | +10        |
| **PilotSubpersonaCore**     | -10        | +10        |
| **GravAnchor**              | -10        | +10        |
| **GravcorePowerCell**       | -5         | +5         |
